# Toolkit Data

This repo contains:
- assignments submitted to the Digitial Toolkit for Linguists course
- handouts given in the same said course

NOTE: I immediately added files to this repo in the way that made sense to me and my pre-existing directory structure. So I then removed and added in the various data types afterwards
